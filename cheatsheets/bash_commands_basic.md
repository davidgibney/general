```bash
# View the manual for target command
man command

# Get help with a target command (probably the same as above, but not always):
command -h

# In case you forget the name of a command, print possible commands relating to any given word:
apropos word

# View index of help pages:
info

*** Command Line Utilities:
**** Basic File and Directory Operations:
# Print current working directory:
pwd

# Show files in current directory:
ls

# Show maximum information about all files, including hidden:
ls -a

# Recurse into subdirectories and list those as well:
ls -R

# List files by modification time, most recent first.
ls -lt

# Move/rename a file or directory (be careful that you don't move the source over a destination with the same name):
mv source destination

# Delete target forever (be very careful), use -r recursive flag for directories:
rm target

# Copy file or directory:
cp source destination

# Mount filesytem:
mount /dev/device_name /media/device_name

# Unmount:
umount /media/device_name

# Forensically clone filesystems and do other low-level operations on files. Be careful with this one. Can be destructive:
dd

# Work with disk partitions:
parted

# Filesystem creation tool:
mkfs

**** System Administration:

# Execute command as an administrator (can be destructive/insecure. Use only for system administration tasks):
sudo command

# Become system administrator:
sudo -s

# Quit system administration:
exit

# Forgot to type sudo in front of a command and already hit enter? Repeat the last command using sudo:
sudo !!

***** Installing software from a .tgz (also known as a tarball):

# First, unzip the tarball (see section on tar, below)
# Next, move into unzipped directory:
cd software_directory

# Always read README first if it is provided, in case there are any modifications to the procedure outlined below:
cat README

# Automatically check for appropriate configurations and generate a MAKE file in the directory:
./configure

# Compile software. May require sudo:
make

# Move files into their appropriate locations. May also require sudo:
make install

# Clean up files in directory, in case make command fails, or just to remove unnecessary cruft:
make clean

***** Ubuntu/Debian Software repositories:

# Check distro repositories for software updates:
sudo apt-get update

# Download and install updates (update first):
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Search for package in the repositories:
apt-cache search keyword

# Get more detail on one specific package:
apt-cache show package_name

# Download and install a package:
sudo apt-get install package_name

# View the output of a command in a more convenient format:
command | less

**** Working With Files:

# Print a file in terminal:
cat file

# Find files matching filename:
locate filename

# See the version of a program or the location of the program
which appname

# Search through filename for matches to phrase:
grep phrase filename

# Search through output of a command for phrase:
command | grep phrase

**** Working With Processes:

# List all running processes:
ps -e

# Standard system monitor showing a more extensive view of all processes and system resources:
top

# Like top, but with a better, cleaner interface:
htop

# Stop a process from using all system resources and lagging computer:
renice process_name

# Kill misbehaving process (use sparingly, last resort, try 'renice' command first):
pkill process name

# Start a process in the background
command &

# Start a process in the background and have it keep running after you log off
nohup command &

**** Compression and Encryption:

# Make a simple compressed backup of files or directories:
tar -cvzf backup_output.tgz target_files_or_directories

# Open a compressed .tgz or .tar.gz file:
tar -xvf target.tgz

# Encrypt a file:
gpg -o outputfilename.gpg -c target_file

# Decrypt a file:
gpg -o outputfilename -d target.gpg

# Zip and encrypt a directory simultaneously:
gpg-zip -o encrypted_filename.tgz.gpg -c -s file_to_be_encrypted

*** The Bash shell:
**** File Name expansions:
# Current user's home directory:
~/

# Current directory:
./

# Parent directory:
../

# Or even (Two parent directories down):
../../

# All files in target directory. (Be very careful.):
/*

**** Output Redirects:

# Redirect output of one command into the input of another with a pipe:
command_1 | command_2

# Or even:

command_1 | command_2 | command_3

# Redirect output to a file:
command > file

# Or:

file > file

# Or even, to redirect in a different direction:
file < file

# Append output rather than writing over the target file:

file_or_command >> file

# Works like |, but it writes output to both target and terminal:
tee target

# Redirect standard output and error to /dev/null, where it is deleted.
command > /dev/null 2>&1

**** Controlling Execution:
# Wait until command 1 is finished to execute command 2
command_1 ; command_2

# Or even:
command_1 ; command_2 ; command_3

# && acts like ; but only executes command_2 if command_1 indicates that it succeeded without error by returning 0.
command_1 && command_2

# || acts like && but only executes command_2 if command_1 indicates an error by returning 1.
command_1 || command_2

**** Bash Wildcards:
# Zero or more characters:
*

# Matches "phrase" and any number of trailing characters:
phrase*

# Matches any incidences of "phrase" with any trailing or leading chars:
*phrase*

# Matches any one char:
?

# Matches any of the characters listed inside brackets:
[chars]

# Matches a range of chars between a-z:
[a-z]

# Copy files/directory over the network from one machine to another recursively:
scp -r source_filename:username@ip_address target_filename:target_username@target_ip_address

# Pipe the output of a command to a target ip and port over the network:
command | netcat -w number_of_seconds_before_timeout target_ip target_port
